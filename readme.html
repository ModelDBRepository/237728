<html>This is the readme for the model associated with the paper:<p/>

Bloss EB, Cembrowski MS, Karsh B, Colonell J, Fetter RD, Spruston N (2018) Single excitatory axons form clustered synapses onto CA1 pyramidal cell dendrites Nature Neuroscience<p/>

This model was contributed by MS Cembrowski. The model requires NEURON which is freely available at <a href="http://www.neuron.yale.edu">http://www.neuron.yale.edu</a><p/>

If you need additional help than that provided below, please read this web page  <a href="https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/NEURON_DwnldGuide.cshtml">https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/NEURON_DwnldGuide.cshtml</a><p/>

To run the model on unix/linux platforms, compile the mod files in the top level folder by cd'ing to it and typeing nrnivmodl on the command line.<p/>
Then start with a command like "nrngui mosinit.hoc". The simulation should produce a graph like:<p/>
